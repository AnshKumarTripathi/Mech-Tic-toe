      <h2>üõ†Ô∏è The Mechanical Origins</h2>
      <p>
        Before CPUs and GPUs, engineers built machines that could "think" using relays, rods, and gears! This simulation
        pays homage to those pioneers who crafted early game-playing devices entirely out of hardware.
      </p>

      <h3>‚ö° The Nimatron (1940)</h3>
      <p>
        One of the earliest electro-mechanical game machines, the <strong><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimatron" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Nimatron</a></strong>, played the game of Nim. Built by Dr. Edward Condon for the
        <strong>1940 New York World‚Äôs Fair</strong>, it used relays (electric switches) to process moves and play
        against humans.
      </p>

      <h3>üß± The Tinkertoy Computer</h3>
      <p>
        In the late 1970s, MIT students <strong>Danny Hillis</strong> and <strong>Brian Silverman</strong> built a
        mechanical Tic-Tac-Toe AI entirely from <strong>Tinkertoy</strong> rods and spools. This wooden machine could
        play a perfect game‚Äîno electricity required!
      </p>
      <p>
        It worked like a physical decision tree: the player would input their move, and the system of rods and levers
        would mechanically evaluate the best counter-move.

      <h3>üé≤ MENACE: Matchboxes, Beads, and Learning</h3>
      <p>
        In 1960, British computer scientist <strong>Donald Michie</strong> built <strong><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MENACE_(machine)" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">MENACE</a></strong> (Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine), a Tic-Tac-Toe
        machine made entirely from <strong>matchboxes</strong> and <strong>colored beads</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each matchbox represented a game state, and beads inside it represented possible moves. During gameplay, the AI
        picked a random bead to choose its move. After the game:
      <ul>
        <li>üèÜ If MENACE won, it added more beads for that move (reinforcing success)</li>
        <li>‚ùå If it lost, it removed some beads (punishing bad moves)</li>
        <li>ü§ù If it drew, it did nothing</li>
      </ul>
      This method allowed MENACE to <strong>learn from experience</strong> ‚Äî all without any electronics!

    <div class="info-column info-right">
      <h2>ü§ñ How This Simulation Works</h2>
      <p>
        This digital AI mimics the strategy of a mechanical machine or a matchbox AI:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Try to Win:</strong> If the AI can win in one move, it does.</li>
        <li><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ Block the Opponent:</strong> If the player is about to win, the AI blocks.</li>
        <li><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Choices:</strong> If neither apply, it plays center, corner, or edge in that order.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical vs Digital Intelligence</h3>
      <p>
        Early mechanical and analog "AIs" hardcoded their logic into their structure. They couldn‚Äôt learn or adapt
        unless someone physically changed them. In contrast, modern simulations (like this one) run logic via code but
        mimic that same deterministic behavior.
