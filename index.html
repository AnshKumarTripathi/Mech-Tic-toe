  <h1>Mechanical Tic-Tac-Toe Simulation</h1>

      <h2>The Mechanical Origins</h2>
      <p>
        Long before silicon chips and software, pioneers created game-playing "AI" using physical mechanisms. This
        simulation honors those early marvels of engineering.
      </p>

      <h3>Early Electro-Mechanical Games: The Nimatron</h3>
      <p>
        One of the earliest examples of an automatic game machine was the <strong>Nimatron</strong>, built by Dr. Edward
        Condon and his colleagues at Westinghouse Electric. It was displayed at the <strong>1940 New York World's
          Fair</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it played the game of Nim, not Tic-Tac-Toe, the Nimatron was significant because it used
        electro-mechanical <strong>relays</strong> (electric switches) connected in complex circuits to represent the
        game's logic and make decisions. It demonstrated that machines could perform logical operations to play a
        strategy game against humans.
      </p>

      <h3>Purely Mechanical Logic: The Tinkertoy Computer</h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most famous example directly related to this simulation is the Tic-Tac-Toe machine built purely from
        <strong>Tinkertoys</strong>. In the late 1970s, MIT students <strong>Danny Hillis</strong> and <strong>Brian
          Silverman</strong> constructed a computer from wooden Tinkertoy rods, spools, and string that could play a
        perfect game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This machine contained no electronic components. The player would make their move by setting parts of the
        machine, which would then physically trigger a cascade of Tinkertoy rods and levers. These represented the
        game's decision tree – checking for wins, blocks, or strategic positions based entirely on the physical
        arrangement and interaction of the parts. Its design was later detailed by <strong>A. K. Dewdney</strong> in his
        "Computer Recreations" column in Scientific American in <strong>1989</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>The Core Idea</h3>
      <p>
        These machines, whether using relays or Tinkertoys, encoded game strategy directly into their physical
        structure. Every possible game state and the corresponding optimal response were built into the hardware itself
        – a tangible finite state machine.

      <h2>How This Simulated AI Works</h2>
      <p>
        This simulation mimics the fixed logic of a mechanical Tic-Tac-Toe machine:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Check to Win:</strong> Can the AI ('X') win immediately? If yes, it makes that move.</li>
        <li><strong>Check to Block:</strong> Can the Player ('O') win on their next turn? If yes, the AI blocks that
          spot.</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic Move:</strong> If neither applies, it follows a built-in optimal strategy: take the
          center, then a corner, then a side.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Mechanical vs. Digital AI</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike modern digital AI (which runs algorithms like Minimax or uses machine learning on general processors),
        the original mechanical AI had its strategy physically *hardwired* into its structure. It was essentially a
        complex finite state machine built from physical parts, reacting predictably to every possible game state. It
        couldn't learn or change its strategy without physical modification.
